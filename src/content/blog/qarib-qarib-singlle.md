# Review

Hindi cinema has always found innovative ways to explore love and relationships. But **Qarib Qarib Singlle**, released in 2017, stands out as a film that brings romance and self-discovery to the forefront in a quirky and refreshing way. Directed by Tanuja Chandra, this film is not just a rom-com but a beautiful celebration of life’s varied colors. With stellar performances by Irrfan Khan and Parvathy Thiruvothu, it offers a unique blend of humor, emotion, and life lessons.

### **The Storyline**

The film begins with Jaya (Parvathy), an introverted and serious widow, who meets Yogi (Irrfan Khan), a quirky and free-spirited poet, on a dating app. While Yogi’s demeanor is light-hearted and eccentric, Jaya is practical and reserved, and this stark contrast forms the soul of the movie.

Their first interaction is a laugh-out-loud moment, and soon they embark on a journey together. Yogi insists that Jaya join him on a trip to reconnect with his three ex-girlfriends. Reluctantly, Jaya agrees, seeking a break from her otherwise monotonous life.

This journey takes them to beautiful locations like Haridwar, Rishikesh, Jaipur, and Gangtok. At each stop, new characters add to the narrative, and Yogi and Jaya’s perspectives on life and relationships evolve. Through this trip, both confront the emotional baggage of their pasts and rediscover the joy of living in the present.

### **The Magic of the Characters**

The character development in **Qarib Qarib Singlle** is one of its strongest elements. Jaya is a strong, independent, and emotionally layered woman, and Parvathy brings authenticity and depth to her role. On the other hand, Yogi is carefree and slightly eccentric—sometimes over-the-top but always relatable and endearing, thanks to Irrfan’s effortless charm.

These two characters are at different stages in life. While Jaya carries the caution born of her past experiences and losses, Yogi is on a quest for closure with his exes. Their interactions and gradual understanding of each other add emotional depth, making the film more than just a surface-level rom-com.

### **Lessons on Life**

At its heart, the film teaches us that life is a journey meant to be enjoyed. The conversations between Jaya and Yogi, their handling of past baggage, and their attempts to live in the moment serve as gentle reminders for the audience to embrace life’s imperfections.

One of Yogi’s philosophical gems is particularly memorable:  
_"Life should always have a ‘delete’ button to let go of certain things, but it also needs an ‘undo’ button to fix mistakes."_

### **The Magic of Music**

The music of **Qarib Qarib Singlle** is soulful and perfectly aligned with the story’s emotions. Songs like **"Jaane De"** and **"Khatam Kahani"** enhance the narrative, reflecting the internal and external journeys of the characters. Vishal Mishra’s compositions and Raj Shekhar’s lyrics make the film’s soundtrack unforgettable, with each song feeling like a journey of its own.

### **Quirky Comedy and Real Emotions**

The tone of the film strikes a perfect balance between quirky comedy and realistic emotions. While Irrfan and Parvathy’s natural performances shine, the dialogues and situations are genuinely funny. Every moment—whether it’s Yogi’s weird habits or Jaya’s deadpan sarcasm—brings laughter.

But the film also has moments that tug at your heartstrings. Both characters subtly reveal the pain of their pasts, and their journey toward closure is touching and relatable.
